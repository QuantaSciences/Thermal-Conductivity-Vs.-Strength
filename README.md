# Thermal-Conductivity-Vs.-Strength
To make steam boilers, pyrolysis reactors, and other high temperature-pressure vessels - we need a strong material / alloy that's also highly Thermally-conductive. These are normally Inversely proportional! but certain alloys optimize each. # Research: https://www.google.com/search?q=yield+strength+vs+thermal+conductivity
